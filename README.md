- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hacktinium

- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code! I want to switch careers and become a software dev. I currently work in mechanical engineering.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I am following the FreeCodeCamp.org curriculum.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other newbie/intermediate programmers, especially on any of the FreeCodeCamp.org projects!

- 📫 How to reach me: here on Github or over on the FreeCodeCamp.org forums (username is the same).
